This is Front-end layer for Library Management System (RestLibrary), created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery.

RestLibrary application is created as self-paced project for better understanding Hibernate, and Rest Services. It enables adding, editing and deleting book titles with copies as well as readers. Then it allows creating and returning borrows. The mailing system informs reader about new borrowing and return date (if existing reader email was added).

Please notice: Application is still in progress. RestLibrary is deployed on Heroku free server, it may need even 2 minutes to load data (if it was not used long time).
